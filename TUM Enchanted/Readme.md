## LATEST CHANGELOGS 
2.5  
**BATTLE AI IMPROVEMENTS**  
- ANTIMAGIC: Fixed AI AntiMagic evaluation erroneously considering dispelling all spells instead of only bad ones (good spells are not removed by Antimagic).  
- ANTIMAGIC: Now AI will evaluate casting Antimagic to remove debuff instead of Dispel/Cure for protecting the stack from future casting of mind spells he has already seen.   
  
**BUG FIXES**  
- Fixed rare bug when left clicking on bottom left creatures in town (Thanks to Trebuchet).  
  
**BALANCE**  
- The following creature skills cannot reduce enemy speed lower than 3:  
  - Crippling Attack (Centaur Warlord)  
  - Crippling Shoot (Marksman)  
  - Incapacitating Shoot (Crossbowman)  
  
**GRAPHICS**  
- Fix wrong Imperial Griffin Attack sound attack.  
- Pit Master, Darkness Dragon, Lord of the Swamp and Hell Baron now have new defs and portraits.

2.4.2:  
  
Disabled the following improvement:

2.4.1:
- Fixed crash on generating random map.

2.4.0:  
  
**BATTLE AI IMPROVEMENTS**  
- ANTIMAGIC: Fixed AI evaluating using Antimagic for removing spells he cannot remove due to having too low Earth Magic level. Now he will consider only spells he can successfully remove.  
- ANTIMAGIC: Now AI will evaluate casting Antimagic to remove debuff instead of Dispel/Cure for protecting the stack from future casting of mind spells he has already seen.   
- DISPEL/CURE/ANTIMAGIC: Now AI will evaluate using those spells for removing BLIND/STONE/PARALYZE.  

**BUG FIXES**  
- Fixed Map drawing error.

- Fixed a bug which prevented AI from casting Teleport.  
- Fixed Beholder attack always casting Blind and Hypnotize.  
- Fixed crash when mouse over-ing a creature for Astral Spirit cast.  
- Reworked building twice a turn mechanic for TUM, now it works also in turn 1 for TUM Buildings and when toggling the WOG options and starting/loading a game.  

**TOWN SCREEN COSMETIC IMPROVEMENTS** (thanks to Trebuchet)
- Fixed building names in Fort.  
- Rewrote left clicking on bottom left creatures in town, now it works smoothly as the original one.
